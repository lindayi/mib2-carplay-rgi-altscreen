# MHI2Q CarPlay Virtual Cockpit Integration (AltScreen + Route Guidance)

Unified CarPlay patch set for Audi MHI2Q infotainment with Audi Virtual Cockpit.  
Integrates **[MHI2Q-CarPlay-AltScreen](https://github.com/yuedizhibo/MHI2Q-CarPlay-AltScreen)** (CarPlay instrument cluster video streaming) with **[mib2q-carplay-rgi](https://github.com/luka-dev/mib2q-carplay-rgi)** (3D turn-by-turn route guidance & maneuver renderer) into one single codebase and all-in-one SD card build.

**Tested & verified on:** Audi Q5 (FY) 2019 · `MHI2Q_ER_AUG22_P5092` · MU Software `1329`.

**Additional owner-verified configuration:** Audi Q5 2020 · `MHI2Q_US_AUG22_P5145` · MU Software `1316`.
On 2026-09-26, the owner reported a successful in-place upgrade from upstream
MHI2Q-CarPlay-AltScreen and working operation, using a Java patch built against
that unit's exported stock `lsd.jxe`. This confirms initial installation and
operation, not exhaustive feature coverage or long-term reliability.

**Disclaimer:** Use at your own risk. These patches modify firmware binaries and system configurations on your infotainment unit. Always back up all original files before making any changes. The authors are not responsible for any damage, bricked devices, or warranty issues resulting from use of these patches.

## ✨ Features

There is nothing to switch on: plug in the iPhone and CarPlay starts as usual; the cluster
features below follow it automatically.

- **AltScreen: CarPlay cluster video on the Virtual Cockpit.** Renders the second-screen CarPlay video
  stream (Apple Maps full cluster map) directly inside the Audi Virtual Cockpit via displayable 3.
- **Smooth 30 fps cluster video.** Upstream AltScreen showed ~15 fps: its frame tap read back only
  every second decoded frame, and the mirror sidecar polled every 20 ms on a fixed 33 ms period.
  The SD build patches both binaries, so the cluster shows 28-30 of the iPhone's 30 fps
  (car-verified, `MIRROR_PRESENT_FPS` in STATUS).
- **Corrected aspect ratio (no distortion).** The mirror sidecar was rebuilt with corrected 1:1 aspect ratio
  geometry (clean bottom crop) so the CarPlay cluster video is not stretched or squashed on the Virtual Cockpit.
- **Clean OEM look (watermark removed & Audi logo).** Upstream promotional watermarks are removed
  (transparent overlay), and the startup screen uses a clean Audi logo (`logo.rgba`) instead of third-party branding.
- **Turn-by-turn route guidance + 3D maneuver renderer.** Real-time 3D maneuver arrow, lane guidance,
  distance to turn, remaining distance and arrival time. When AltScreen video is active, `ScreenModule`
  automatically selects **Display Context 81** (`{98, 101, 102, 3}`), compositing the custom 3D
  maneuver overlay and KDK backings cleanly on top of the live video stream.
  Needs an app that sends CarPlay route guidance: Apple Maps and Google Maps do, AMap does with its
  CarPlay guidance setting on, Waze does not
  ([details](docs/rgd/rgd-activation.md#-which-navigation-apps-send-route-guidance)).
- **Seamless automatic fallback (Context 80 / 74).** When the AltScreen video stream is idle, not ready,
  or running in standalone route-guidance mode, `ScreenModule` seamlessly falls back to **Context 80**
  (3D maneuver arrow over the stock native Audi map) or resting **Context 74**
  ([details](docs/cluster/display-contexts.md)).
- **Route text in the Virtual Cockpit.** A text line names the exit sign or the next road (the
  current road when there is nothing else); long names scroll. Press **OK** (the left steering-wheel
  roller) to switch it to arrival time and time left, and press again to go back; it returns by itself
  after 20 s ([details](docs/rgd/vc-route-text.md)).
- **Head-up display.** The same maneuver icons, lane arrows and distance appear on the HUD.
- **Next-turn labels in the custom RGI panel.** Distance and the next road/exit appear beneath
  the arrow, with lane guidance reserved above them. Distance uses the same stock MMI formatter
  as BAP (including imperial units); unknown values and ended routes clear the labels.
  This does not move or repurpose the cockpit's native destination-distance widget.
  The new overlay is host-tested, not yet vehicle-verified; see
  [renderer details](docs/cluster/maneuver-renderer.md#route-label-footer).
- **Steering-wheel roller zoom for CarPlay map & stock map.** While the AltScreen CarPlay video is on
  the Virtual Cockpit, each click of the left steering-wheel roller sends the factory AirPlay
  `changeMapZoomLevel` command to the iPhone for the cluster display (matching OEM CarPlay behavior).
  Scrolling away zooms out, scrolling towards you zooms in. The native Audi map beneath the video also
  continues to zoom ([details](docs/input/steering-wheel.md)).
- **Cluster map layout selector (car marker centering).** To address the car location marker
  offset caused by iOS reserving space for its own maneuver card, the MMI-Cockpit-Carplay GEM menu
  provides a **Cluster map layout** selector with four options: *original AltScreen*,
  *maneuver card on top (default)*, *maneuver card on the right*, and *no ETA*
  (applied on next phone reconnect). With no saved preference, the maneuver card
  defaults to the top; upgrades preserve explicitly saved layouts.
- **Cover art on the cluster.** The now-playing album art shows on the cluster media screen.
- **Export-only diagnostics.** GEM **EXPORT DIAGNOSTICS ONLY (no restore)** saves a
  health summary and bounded private log tails to the SD card without stopping,
  restarting, restoring or uninstalling anything.
- **Conservative mirror startup/recovery.** The mirror waits asynchronously for the
  Java cluster controller before initializing. After observing regular presentation
  telemetry, it can recover a stalled mirror while input video keeps advancing.
  Recovery is bounded, checks process identity, and never resets USB or the main
  CarPlay process. Missing telemetry or a stationary input does not trigger a restart.
- **Parking popups no longer hide CarPlay.** When the Audi front PDC / parking view pops up beside it,
  CarPlay stays on screen instead of being replaced ([details](docs/hmi/pdc-small-stage.md)).
- **MMI touchpad → DPAD bridging** so finger drags navigate CarPlay menus.

Raw unit logs and generated class trees are intentionally kept outside Git.

The renderer embeds a small DejaVu-derived font atlas. Keep
`maneuver_render/LICENSE.DEJAVU` with redistributed renderer binaries; the native
build copies it into `build/` and the SD build includes it at the card root.

## 🔧 Build

Native code needs the QNX 6.5 ARMv7 cross-toolchain image from
[luka-dev/qnx65-armv7-toolchain](https://github.com/luka-dev/qnx65-armv7-toolchain). Build it once:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/luka-dev/qnx65-armv7-toolchain
cd qnx65-armv7-toolchain
./host-scripts/qnx-run.sh build        # qnx65-armv7-toolchain:latest (GCC 8.5)
```

Then run from this repository's root:

```sh
./scripts/build_java.sh        # → build/carplay_hook.jar
./scripts/build_hook.sh        # → build/libcarplay_hook.so
./scripts/build_renderers.sh   # → build/maneuver_render
```

All three build in Docker - no host toolchain required. The Java patch compiles in a pinned
`eclipse-temurin:8` container (against the stock jar + OSGi libs under `../../Tools/jxe2jar`; the
scripts expect the author's `out/MU1316-final.jar`, so if your own stock jar is named or located
differently, set `TOOLS_DIR` to your jxe2jar directory and `STOCK_JAR` to the filename
under its `out/` directory for the build; the test scripts have their own paths); the two
native builds use the `qnx65-armv7-toolchain` image and synthesize their import stubs, so the resulting
ELF binds the unit's real Screen/EGL/GLES libraries at runtime. The renderer's C++ scene engine is
built with that image's `g++` and must not pull in the C++ runtime; the hook build rejects any dynamic
export beyond its five interposers. There are no Java variants.

There is one hook image: logging is always compiled in, WARN/ERROR by default, INFO with the
`carplay_verbose` marker (see [Logging](#-logging)). The only build-time switch is for debugging:

```sh
./scripts/build_hook.sh                        # production image
LOG_RGD_PACKET_RAW=1 ./scripts/build_hook.sh   # + raw RGD packet hex dumps
```

### AltScreen SD card (CarPlay video on the VC + route guidance)

`altscreen/` holds the [MHI2Q-CarPlay-AltScreen](https://github.com/yuedizhibo/MHI2Q-CarPlay-AltScreen)
SD tree (CarPlay's instrument-cluster video on the Virtual Cockpit) with this project's route
guidance wired into its installer. One command builds everything and stages a ready card:

```sh
STOCK_JAR=MU1329-base.jar ./scripts/build_sd.sh                  # -> build/sd/
SD=/Volumes/SD32 STOCK_JAR=MU1329-base.jar ./scripts/build_sd.sh   # ... and copy onto the card
```

It fills in the JAR size/cksum that AltScreen's INSTALL/START/STATUS pin and regenerates
`SHA256SUMS-SD.txt`; the card's `MMI-Cockpit-Carplay/` (AltScreen stock backups) is never touched.
On the car: **Toolbox -> Update Toolbox**, then **MMI-Cockpit-Carplay -> INSTALL**, reboot, **START**,
reboot. While the video runs the cluster uses ctx 81 (`{98, 101, 102, 3}`, maneuver panel over the
video); without it route guidance falls back to ctx 80 over the stock map
([display-contexts](docs/cluster/display-contexts.md)). **STATUS** reports `DIO_PRELOAD_ALTSCREEN`,
`DIO_PRELOAD_RGI`, `RGI_*` and the live context. **RESTORE ORIGINAL** removes both.
The steering-wheel roller zooms the CarPlay cluster map as it zooms the native one
([steering-wheel](docs/input/steering-wheel.md)); the GEM menu's **Cluster map layout** entries pick
the iPhone's cluster presentation (applied on the next phone connect).
The build also patches AltScreen's `libcarplay_altscreen.so` and mirror sidecar for 30 fps
cluster video (`tools/patch_altscreen_fps.py`; each patch checks the exact upstream binary first);
`ALTSCREEN_FULL_FPS=0` ships them unchanged. GEM **Dump cluster video to SD (diagnostic)** saves
the last ~4 MB of the cluster H.264 stream to `MMI-Cockpit-Carplay/logs/h264/`;
`python3 tools/h264_ring_analyze.py <file>` shows what the iPhone sent.
End-to-end check of the package (needs an AltScreen stock backup from a unit):
`FIXTURE=<card>/MMI-Cockpit-Carplay/backup ./scripts/test_altscreen_e2e.sh`.
This host test explicitly stubs the ARM mirror launcher; it checks every command's
exit status and the integrated completion message, not actual video output. It
also exercises interrupted restore, cleanup failures, and retry recovery. Restore
verifies the stock launcher configuration before removing the RGI runtime; failed
cleanup retains the recovery scripts and pending transaction for a retry.

#### Key enhancements over upstream AltScreen:
- **30 fps instead of 15:** the frame tap reads back every decoded frame and the mirror sidecar polls every 4 ms with a one-vsync minimum period (binary patches applied by `build_sd.sh`).
- **Steering-wheel cluster map zoom:** Each roller click sends `changeMapZoomLevel` directly to iOS via AirPlay (`CRSUIClusterZoomAction`); scrolling away zooms out, scrolling towards zooms in.
- **Cluster map layout selector (vehicle marker centering):** GEM menu provides four selectable layouts (`original AltScreen`, `maneuver card on top (default)`, `maneuver card on the right`, `no ETA`) to balance map layout and vehicle marker centering without obscuring navigation.
- **Corrected aspect ratio & projection:** Instead of stretching or squashing the image, the mirror sidecar is rebuilt with a 1:1 aspect ratio and clean bottom crop so that maps and road geometry display with natural proportions.
- **Removed watermarks:** Upstream advertising and promotional text watermarks are removed (`watermark.rgba` is completely transparent).
- **OEM Audi startup logo:** Replaced third-party repository startup branding with an authentic Audi logo (`logo.rgba`).
- **Seamless RGI companion:** The integrated `rgi_companion.sh` automatically wires both the AltScreen universal preload and `libcarplay_hook.so` via `CARPLAY_PRELOAD_EXTRA` without clobbering the environment.

### Tests

Host-only, no unit needed:

```sh
./scripts/run_tests.sh            # C + shell: RGD parser, bus, cover art, shader cache, installer, supervisor
./scripts/test_route_info.sh      # Java route-guidance / BAP bridge against the stock interfaces
./scripts/test_java_transports.sh # Java bus + renderer sockets, touchpad
./scripts/test_maneuver_native.sh # renderer engine + lanes (macOS, ASan/UBSan)
```

The Java suites need the stock MU1316 jar and JDK under `../../Tools/jxe2jar`. Full toolchain,
threading, boot and the complete test list live in the knowledge base - see
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## 🚀 Deployment

**Compatibility & Tested Hardware:**
- **Confirmed & verified working on:**
  - **Vehicle:** Audi Q5 (FY) 2019
  - **Firmware Release:** `MHI2Q_ER_AUG22_P5092`
  - **MU Software:** `1329`
- **Supported units:** Any Audi MHI2Q infotainment unit (developed and tested on MU1316 and MU1329).
  What matters is:
  - A fully digital instrument cluster (**Audi Virtual Cockpit**); analog clusters are not supported.
  - Preferably the latest firmware available for the unit, flashed before installing.

---

### Option 1: Unified AltScreen + Route Guidance SD Card (Recommended)

This installs both **AltScreen** (full CarPlay cluster video stream on the Virtual Cockpit) and **Route Guidance Integration (RGI)** (3D maneuver arrow overlay, lane guidance, route text, HUD) using the integrated MIB2 Toolbox.

1. **Build the SD card image:**
   ```sh
   STOCK_JAR=MU1329-base.jar ./scripts/build_sd.sh                  # stages files into build/sd/
   SD=/Volumes/SD32 STOCK_JAR=MU1329-base.jar ./scripts/build_sd.sh   # or copies directly onto your SD card
   ```
2. **Insert the SD card** into slot 1 (SD1) of the MMI unit.
3. **Open GEM** (Green Engineering Menu):
   - Go to **Toolbox -> Update Toolbox** to load the scripts.
   - Go to **MMI-Cockpit-Carplay -> INSTALL**. The companion installer (`rgi_companion.sh`) automatically installs the native RGI files to `/mnt/app/root/hooks/`, places the unified HMI jar `carplay_hook-basevideo3.jar`, and patches `smartphone_integrator.json` (with `CARPLAY_PRELOAD_EXTRA`) and `dio_manager.json`.
4. **Reboot the unit** normally.
5. **Open GEM -> MMI-Cockpit-Carplay -> START** to activate the mirror display service.
6. **Reboot the unit.**

**On-Car Verification & Features:**
- **Steering-wheel zoom:** Start CarPlay with the navigation map on the Virtual Cockpit and turn the left steering-wheel roller ("away" = zoom out, "towards" = zoom in).
- **Vehicle marker alignment:** Build a route in CarPlay, navigate to **MMI-Cockpit-Carplay -> Cluster map layout** in GEM, and try the four options (`original AltScreen`, `maneuver card on top (default)`, `maneuver card on the right`, `no ETA`), reconnecting the phone after each. These are iPhone layout requests, not direct control of the vehicle marker; their effect can differ by navigation app.
- **STATUS:** Run **MMI-Cockpit-Carplay -> STATUS** in GEM to inspect system health. It reports `DIO_PRELOAD_ALTSCREEN`, `DIO_PRELOAD_RGI`, `RGI_*` status, and the live display context from `/tmp/carplay_cluster.ctx`.
- **RESTORE ORIGINAL:** Selecting **RESTORE ORIGINAL** in GEM cleanly removes all patches and restores the stock firmware configuration from backup.

---

### Option 2: Standalone Route Guidance (Without AltScreen Video)

For users who want route guidance and 3D maneuver arrows drawn only over the native Audi cluster map without the CarPlay video stream.

A release consists of eight files plus two config edits; nothing stock is replaced:

| On-unit path | Files |
| --- | --- |
| `/mnt/app/root/hooks/` | `libcarplay_hook.so`, `maneuver_render` (from `build/`), `flag_atlas.rgba` (from `maneuver_render/resources/`), `carplay_startup.sh`, `carplay_monitor.sh`, `carplay_processes.sh`, `carplay_cleanup.sh` (from `deploy/smartphone_integrator/`) |
| `/mnt/app/eso/hmi/lsd/jars/` | `carplay_hook.jar` (from `build/`) |
| `/mnt/system/etc/eso/production/smartphone_integrator.json` | `children.carplay` replaced by [`carplay_child.json`](deploy/smartphone_integrator/carplay_child.json) |
| `/mnt/system/etc/eso/production/dio_manager.json` | `MessagesSentByAccessory` += `0x5200`, `0x5203`; `MessagesReceivedFromDevice` += `0x5201`, `0x5202`, `0x5204` |

Both the `dio_manager.json` IDs and the hook's runtime Identify patch are required: without the IDs
iOS sends route guidance and the SDK silently drops it.

- **With M.I.B. (recommended for standalone RGI):** Copy `install_MoreIncredibleBash/` to the M.I.B. SD card and drop
  all release assets straight into `mod/carplay/` (the eight files above plus `carplay_child.json`), then run
  **GEM -> M.I.B. -> Advanced Settings -> Run Custom Script** with CarPlay disconnected. To remove, run
  `uninstall_MoreIncredibleBash/`.
- **Manually:** Over root shell (SSH or Telnet). See [`docs/deploy/install.md`](docs/deploy/install.md) for the complete
  step-by-step guide.

**Reboot.** Disconnect CarPlay, run `sync` and wait a few seconds, then reboot normally: a forced
reboot (the MMI button combo) right after copying can leave files truncated or missing. On boot
`smartphone_integrator` launches everything; check the logs in `/tmp`.

Exact ownership rules, the `LD_PRELOAD`/env constraints and the MU1316 QNX-compat audit are in
[`deploy/smartphone_integrator/README.md`](deploy/smartphone_integrator/README.md).

## 📝 Logging

### Export without changing the installation

While parked, select **GEM -> Customization -> MMI-Cockpit-Carplay ->
EXPORT DIAGNOSTICS ONLY (no restore)** with the prepared SD inserted.
It creates `MMI-Cockpit-Carplay/logs/exports/export_<timestamp>_<pid>/` containing:

- `SUMMARY.txt`: selected firmware/context/readiness fields, process liveness,
  mirror-health state, last reported frame counters and whether the installed JAR
  matches the SD package. A readiness marker is not proof of live pixels.
- `private/`: up to 256 KiB from each of twelve known logs. These are **raw,
  not anonymized**; they can contain road names, destinations and device/network
  details. Keep them local and review/redact before sharing.
- `FILES.txt`, `PRIVACY.txt`, and `CKSUMS.txt`: missing/error inventory and integrity data.

An export error leaves the current installation running. **STORE LOGS + RESTORE
still restores the vehicle configuration; it is not the export-only action.**

### Mirror recovery scope

The boot launcher waits for this fork's `carplay_cluster.ctx` before executing the
mirror; it does not delay `dio_manager`. With a live phone process but no Java
controller, each attempt times out after 90 polls (approximately 90 seconds).
Without a phone it may wait quietly for a later connection.
The initial delayed launch enables the native sidecar's guarded same-session
recovery, so a cluster-stream request arriving before HMI readiness is not missed.

Live-freeze recovery requires independently changing H.264 header counters and at
least two observed presentation-counter advances. The stall threshold is at least
40 active-input polls and at least four times the observed reporting interval.
Only an identity-verified mirror process may be signaled; no-input/unknown telemetry
is not evidence of a freeze. The existing default limit of three abnormal restarts
still applies. Exhaustion withdraws stale readiness so Java can fall back to stock
map/RGI, and explicit STOP remains authoritative. This does not fix every possible
decoder/HMI fault or guarantee recovery before the first frame.

Everything logs to `/tmp` on the unit:

| File | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `/tmp/carplay_hook.log` | native hook (inside `dio_manager`) |
| `/tmp/carplay_java.log` | Java patch (bounded + rotated, `.1` = previous) |
| `/tmp/maneuver_render.log` | cluster maneuver renderer |
| `/tmp/carplay_wrapper.log` | startup wrapper, preload merger (`CARPLAY_PRELOAD_EXTRA`), and renderer monitor |
| `/tmp/carplay_cluster.ctx` | active cluster display context (`81` = AltScreen video + maneuver, `80` = maneuver on stock map, `74` = idle) |

By default only warnings and errors are recorded. To capture **everything** (lift hook and Java to
`INFO`), drop a marker file on the unit - no rebuild needed:

```sh
touch /mnt/app/carplay_verbose        # survives reboot; /tmp/carplay_verbose does not
```

Hook and Java read the marker at every CarPlay session start, so it takes effect on the next phone
connect - no reboot. Remove the marker to return to the quiet default. Logs reset on reboot, so pull
them before restarting.

For raw route-guidance packet dumps, rebuild the hook with `LOG_RGD_PACKET_RAW=1` (see [Build](#-build)).

**No shell? Use M.I.B.** Copy `logging_MoreIncredibleBash/` to the card and run it like the installer.
Each run saves everything to `<card>/carplay_logs/NNN/` and then creates `/tmp/carplay_verbose`: run it
once, reconnect the phone and drive with CarPlay, run it again - the second folder holds the verbose
session. Attach that folder to a bug report.

## 📚 Documentation

`docs/` is a Markdown knowledge base (also opens in Obsidian) - one note per topic, each fact validated against code /
firmware / iOS binary. Start at [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md): architecture & threading, the hook
and bus, route guidance (TLV → BAP → cluster, lanes, route text), cluster compositing and the maneuver
renderer, input, deploy/connect, build & host tests, the reverse-engineering references, and a
per-note verification status.

## 🤝 Help wanted

PRs are welcome - bug fixes, new maneuver cases, docs, on-car test reports.

**Reporting a bad maneuver icon.** The iAP2→BAP mapping covers all 54 CarPlay maneuver types but has
only been exercised on a limited set of real routes. A snippet of `/tmp/carplay_hook.log` from the
moment plus a note on what was expected helps a lot. The hook logs unrecognised route-guidance messages
as `[HOOK] Unknown 0x52xx msgid=0xNNNN dir=IN len=N` followed by a hex dump - that line is the best
starting point when iOS sends a maneuver type we don't handle yet.
